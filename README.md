### Features

* .dsk, .do, .po, .2mg, .hdv image files supported

### Known Problems

* After adding a new file or directory to the root of a drive image, that new file/directory appears in every mounted image, not just the target.  Clicking away from VSCode and then back updates all drive images to their correct state.
